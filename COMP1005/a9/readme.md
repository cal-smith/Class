In this assignment, you will be making your very own game. It should be similar in scope and quality to the Asteroids game made in class, but **it must be different from any game made in the lectures or tutorials.**

Note: this assignment is being posted **early** so that you have some time to think about what kind of game you'd like to make, and perhaps plan a bit of it out before you start programming. **You should complete Assignment 8 before starting on Assignment 9.**

As you might suspect, this is a fairly open-ended assignment. Here are the guidelines for the grading of your submission:

1. Your game should take place in a window that is 800 pixels wide by 600 pixels high.
2. Playing your game should require some kind of skill (for example: good reflexes, good memory, trivia knowledge, mathematical skill, etc.). Although luck can play a component, the game should not be entirely luck-based (for example: guessing if a coin flip is heads or tails would make for a boring game no matter how well it was executed; similarly for a trivia game about a very obscure topic).
3. The player should lose the game if he or she makes too many "mistakes" (for example: wrong guesses, deaths, damage, etc.). How close the player is to losing should be apparent to the player.
4. The difficulty of the game should increase as time goes on.
5. No situation (including deliberately incorrect input) should cause your game to crash or behave in a clearly incorrect way (for example, moving off the screen unless this is obviously part of the game). You may, however, count incorrect input as a "mistake" as described above. 
6. The game should include appropriately licensed background music that plays during the duration of the game.
7. The game should include at least one appropriately licensed sound effect.
8. The game should include at least one appropriately licensed image.
